        Five years ago, TeCanal was founded with the mission of using technology and STEM education to empower youth in low-income communities. Today, TeCanal serves over seventy children in some of the most impoverished communities in Baltimore.

        This summer, TeCanal is running its first software engineering internship program. The internship will begin the week of July 6 and end the week of August 10 (6 weeks). The internship will be done remotely. Since we are a charitable non-profit organization, this is an unpaid volunteer internship.
