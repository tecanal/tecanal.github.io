        Five years ago, TeCanal was founded with the mission of using technology and STEM education to empower youth in low-income communities. Today, TeCanal serves over seventy children in some of the most impoverished communities in Baltimore.
    </p>

    <p>
        This summer, TeCanal is running its first software engineering internship program. The internship will begin the week of July 6 and end the week of August 10 (6 weeks). The internship will be done remotely. Since we are a charitable non-profit organization, this is an unpaid volunteer internship.
